Bonjour, and welcome to my personal website!

I am a **Data scientist** and **Translational researcher**. I recently graduated from my **PhD in Biology** within the *i2TRON Doctoral Training Unit* at the **University of Luxembourg – LCSB**, supervised by Prof. Dr. Reinhard Schneider and Dr. Venkata Satagopam.  
My work focuses on integrating **bioinformatics, systems biology, and multi-omics** to understand the molecular mechanisms in different medical conditions such as **peanut allergy, cancer, and inflammatory diseases**.

I am passionate about innovative technologies and the **bench-to-clinic data integration** that advances precision medicine.  
Beyond research, I contribute to the **scientific community** through different roles in ISCB-RSG Luxembourg and previously in JeBiF, and I am deeply involved in promoting reproducible and responsible research practices.
